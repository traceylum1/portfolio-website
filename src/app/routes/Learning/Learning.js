            I started my CS learning journey after I came back from living and working abroad in Taiwan for 6 years. I worked as an English teacher and editor during my time there, and while I enjoyed both jobs and learned a lot, I knew that neither was my passion.

            After spending several years working in the ESL field, I knew that if I wanted to change my trajectory, I would have to do it soon. So with the hopes of giving myself a fresh new direction in life, I listed all of my interests and skillsets. I analyzed and picked apart each one, but there was nothing that stood out which felt like it could lead to an exciting career path. There was, however, a nagging feeling that had always been at the back of my mind since youth... It was the belief that I was not someone who was 'textbook smart.'

            During my time in the formal education system, I was more involved in extra-curriculars and athletics, and being a student had taken a backseat. I decided that I wanted to challenge this limiting belief of myself and explore fields that would push me beyond what I had ever done intellectually. This time I created a new list--a list of subjects that had always felt overwhelming, intimidating, and simply impossible for me to excel at. Of those at the top of the list, I weighed the subjects which felt most interesting and felt like I would enjoy diving deeper into, and I ended up choosing Computer Science.

            Once I made my decision, I packed my bags and left my comfortable lifestyle in Asia to do what I had never done before: to become a real student and dive headfirst into learning.
