            I started my CS learning journey after I came back from living and working abroad in Taiwan for 6 years. I worked as an English teacher, which I enjoyed, but knew it wasn't my passion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided that I wanted to challenge myself and pursue career goals that would push me beyond what I had ever done. Being a person who was always more involved in extra-curriculars and athletics rather than education, my studies have taken a backseat for most of my life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I participated in the education system enough to pass exams and get by with decent grades, but never truly understood what it meant to <i>learn</i> something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I have a new life goal: To be a life-long student.
